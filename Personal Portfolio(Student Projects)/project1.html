      This project is a Windows Forms-based game I created using C#.  
      The game allows the player to control a spaceship, avoid enemy fire, and destroy enemies to progress through levels.  
      Features include player health, waves of enemies, score tracking, and win/lose conditions.

      This project taught me how to apply **object-oriented programming**, work with **timers**, and integrate **images and resources** into a Windows Forms application.  
      It also improved my debugging skills, as I had to solve multiple accessibility and override errors during development.
