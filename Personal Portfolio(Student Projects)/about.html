        <h2>Who I Am</h2>
        <p>Hello! I’m <strong>Bea Sorinio</strong>, a BSIE-ICT student at the Technological University of the Philippines — Manila. My interest in combining creative design and software development began when I first experimented with simple web pages and desktop apps. I enjoy designing clean user interfaces with gentle color palettes and building small projects that solve simple problems. My coursework has included Windows Forms projects, where I created games and small management systems; I also work on web mini-projects and write reflective notes on my learning process. I value disciplined practice, frequent commits, and documenting steps so others (like instructors) can follow my progress during live checkpoints. Outside of school I like drawing, journaling, and picking pastel color combinations for UI mockups. My goal is to be a professional who builds delightful, accessible systems and mentors other students in tech.</p>

    <section class="card">
      <h3 class="section-title">Experience & Approach</h3>
      <p>I approach projects by sketching a simple UI, listing required features, then building incrementally. I prefer readable code, clear variable names, and adding comments so instructors and teammates can follow along. When I learn new technologies, I apply them in small practice projects and keep a short write-up in my blog page so I can remember the steps and show growth over time.</p>
