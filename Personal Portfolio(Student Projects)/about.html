    <h2>Who I Am</h2>
    <p>
      My name is Bea Sorinio, and I am a BSIE-ICT student at the Technological University of the Philippines – Manila.  
      I am passionate about technology, problem-solving, and design. This website is part of my academic requirement, but it also serves as a personal portfolio where I can share my journey, achievements, and projects.  
    </p>
    <p>
      Aside from academics, I enjoy exploring creative hobbies like digital design, photography, and writing. These activities help me balance my technical studies with creativity and personal growth.  
      I believe in continuous learning and want to use my knowledge to contribute to the future of technology. My dream is to combine innovation with practical solutions that improve people’s lives.
