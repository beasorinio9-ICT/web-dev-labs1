      <h2>Learning Programming as a Student</h2>
      <p>
        Learning programming has been a rewarding and challenging experience.  
        I started with basic concepts in C# and slowly moved to building real projects.  
        The process of debugging, solving problems, and seeing my code work has given me confidence.  
        This journey also taught me the importance of patience and persistence.

      <h2>Balancing Studies and Creativity</h2>
      <p>
        As a student, it can be overwhelming to manage deadlines and projects.  
        I balance my academic responsibilities with creative hobbies like design and writing.  
        These activities not only relax me but also improve my ability to think outside the box.  
        I believe that creativity and technology complement each other in powerful ways.
