        <h1>In this module, I learned how to:</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Understand the basics of <strong>Git</strong> — a version control system that helps track changes in code and collaborate with others.</li>
            <li>Use <strong>GitHub</strong> — a platform for hosting Git repositories, sharing projects, and collaborating with developers worldwide.</li>
            <li>Create a <strong>GitHub account</strong> by visiting <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub Sign Up</a>, entering personal details, verifying your email, and setting up your profile.</li>
            <li>Explore <strong>GitHub Pages</strong> — a feature that allows you to publish websites directly from your GitHub repository, perfect for showcasing portfolios or projects.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This module helped me connect technical tools with creative possibilities, especially in building and sharing web projects like <em>Bean & Bea’s Corner</em>!</p>
