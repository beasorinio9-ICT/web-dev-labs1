    <!-- The problem specifies to link to fix.js, but since there is no JavaScript logic to fix, the file would be empty or contain a comment. A CSS file is needed to define the utility classes, which is a common setup for this type of problem. -->
    <!-- The problem statement references a link to script.js in Activity 1 and fix.js in Activity 2, but the code snippet for Activity 2 is HTML with CSS classes, not JavaScript. This suggests that the corrected code should be an HTML file and possibly a CSS file to define the correct styles. -->
