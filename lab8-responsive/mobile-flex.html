            <h2>Box 1: Project Details</h2>
            <p>This box contains general information about the project. It outlines the objective of creating a responsive layout with Flexbox and a media query. The goal is to ensure the design adapts gracefully to various screen sizes, starting with a mobile-first approach.</p>

            <h2>Box 2: Key Features</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Mobile-First Design: The layout is designed for mobile devices first, with content stacked vertically.</li>
                <li>Flexbox Layout: Utilizes CSS Flexbox to manage the alignment and spacing of the boxes.</li>
                <li>Media Query: A media query is used to apply a different layout for larger screens, changing the direction of the boxes to a row.</li>
                <li>Responsiveness: The layout seamlessly transitions from a single column to multiple columns as the screen size increases.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Box 3: Implementation Notes</h2>
            <p>This section provides a summary of the implementation steps. The container element is set to display: flex. For mobile, the flex-direction is column. A media query (@media (min-width: 768px)) is used to override this, setting the flex-direction to row for wider screens. This ensures a clean and efficient layout on all devices.</p>
