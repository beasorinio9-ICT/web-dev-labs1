        <h1>In this module, I learned how to:</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Apply a <strong>version control workflow</strong> using Git â€” including initializing repositories, staging changes, committing updates, and pushing to remote repositories.</li>
            <li>Organize my web development projects through <strong>GitHub</strong> â€” by creating repositories, managing branches, and tracking progress over time.</li>
            <li>Set up a <strong>GitHub account</strong> to collaborate and showcase my work online. This includes signing up, verifying my email, and customizing my profile.</li>
            <li>Use <strong>GitHub Pages</strong> to publish my website directly from a repository, making it easy to share my projects like <em>ðŸŒ¸ Bea & Bloom CafÃ©</em> with others.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This module taught me how to manage my code efficiently, maintain a clean workflow, and present my creative web projects in a professional and organized way.</p>
